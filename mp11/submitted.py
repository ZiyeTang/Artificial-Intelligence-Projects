        Create a new q_learner object.
        Your q_learner object should store the provided values of alpha,
        epsilon, gamma, and nfirst.
        It should also create a Q table and an N table.

        Both are initialized to all zeros.
        Up to you: how will you encode the state and action in order to
        define these two lookup tables?  The state will be a list of 5 integers,
        such that 0 <= state[i] < state_cardinality[i] for 0 <= i < 5.
        The action will be either -1, 0, or 1.
        It is up to you to decide how to convert an input state and action
        into indices that you can use to access your stored Q and N tables.
